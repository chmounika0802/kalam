    <p>Kalam died on 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on "Creating a Livable Planet Earth"
         at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. The lecture was supposed to be 4000 words, but only after speaking the 
         initial two sentences, Kalam collapsed and he was confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac arrest later at a hospital.
         [3] Kalam's body was airlifted in an Indian Air Force helicopter from Shillong to Guwahati, from where it was flown 
         o New Delhi on the morning of 28 July.[4]

        Following Kalam's death, the Indian Minister of Home Affairs called an emergency meeting of
         the Union Council of Ministers, attended by Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi. In the me
         ting, a proposal to build the "Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam National Memorial" was finalised. Th
          Indian Government proposed to perform Kalam's funeral service at Raj Ghat-(Ekta Sthal) in New 
          elhi, and build a memorial there. Kalam's family objected, since Kalam had wanted to be buried in his 
          ometown, Rameshwaram, and the Indian government agreed to go along with the family's wishes,[5][6] and in the
           same year on Kalam's birth date which is on 15 October, the commencement of construction on a memorial at 
           Rameshwaram was publicized by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.[7] On 27 July 2017, on the occasion of Kalam's 
           second death anniversary, the memorial was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>
